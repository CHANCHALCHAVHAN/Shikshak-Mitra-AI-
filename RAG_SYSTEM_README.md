## 🎯 What It Does

### Before RAG:
```
Teacher Metrics → Basic Analysis → Generic Suggestions
```

### After RAG:
```
Teacher Metrics 
    ↓
RAG System (100+ knowledge items + ML)
    ↓
Personalized Recommendations
    ├─ Immediate actions (with success predictions)
    ├─ Short-term strategies (research-backed)
    ├─ Long-term plans (proven interventions)
    ├─ Similar successful cases
    └─ Subject-specific approaches
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 5-10 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Switch to active learning activity within next 5 minutes
   Target: Engagement | Severity: CRITICAL
   ✓ Success Probability: 85%
   ✓ Expected Improvement: 51%

2. Consciously slow down speaking rate
   Target: Pacing | Severity: MEDIUM
   ✓ Success Probability: 92%
   ✓ Expected Improvement: 15%

SIMILAR SUCCESSFUL CASES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Scenario scenario_002 (Similarity: 0.95)
   Outcome: critical
   What worked: Slow down pace immediately, increase questions, use active learning

PERSONALIZED INSIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Active learning increases retention by 50% compared to passive lectures
   → Spend 60% of class time on active learning activities
